# troubleshooter
Collects useful information from the host system (hardware, logs, etc) for troubleshooting Linux issues

## Use

To use troubleshooter, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/troubleshooter/releases/latest), save it to your Downloads folder in your home directory (or another location you can remember), open up a terminal, run `chmod +x ~/Downloads/troubleshooter.sh` and then run `~/Downloads/troubleshooter.sh`.  If you have an internet connection and `netcat` installed (`netcat` is installed by default on most distributions), the resulting log will be uploaded to [termbin.com](https://termbin.com).  If not, the log will be saved in `~/.cache/troubleshooter.DateInUnixTime.log` so it can be copied to another device and shared.
